# rustlings Solutions ü¶Ä‚ù§Ô∏è

These are my solutions to the `rustlings` exercises.

The `rustlings` project contains small exercises to get you used to reading and
writing Rust code. This includes reading and responding to compiler messages!

If you are a first-time Rust learner like me, I highly recommend you work your
own way through [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) before
looking through the solutions in this repository.

There are several other resources, as well:

- [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html) - The most comprehensive
  resource for learning Rust, but a bit theoretical sometimes. You will be using
  this along with Rustlings!
- [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) -
  Learn Rust by solving little exercises! It's almost like `rustlings`, but
  online

## Continuing On

Once you've completed Rustlings, put your new knowledge to good use! Continue
practicing your Rust skills by building your own projects, contributing to
Rustlings, or finding other open-source projects to contribute to.
